1. What is the purpose of using sample text?

Sample text is used to demonstrate layout, design, or functionality before the final content is ready. It helps in testing readability, formatting, and user experience.

2. What is the most common type of sample text?

“Lorem Ipsum” is the most commonly used form of sample text. Though it’s not in English, it has become a standard placeholder in the design and publishing industries.

3. Can I create my own sample text?

Yes, you can create your own sample text. Many designers and developers prefer to use custom English sentences to closely mimic the final content.

4. Why is “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” used as sample text?
